# Mission-to-Mars

## Summary
The goal of this challenge was to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape from two differenct websites to create a flask web page to display information about the planet Mars. The scraped data was stored on a Mongo database and then relayed to a web page using flask. Bootstrap components were used to accommodate the images displayed and customize the scrape button. The webpage is also responsive to mobile devices.
