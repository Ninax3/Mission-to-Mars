# Mission-to-Mars

## Summary
The goal of this challenge was to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape from two differenct websites to create a flask web page to display information about the planet Mars. The scraped data was stored on a Mongo database and then relayed to a web page using flask. Bootstrap components were used to accommodate the images displayed and customize the scrape button. The webpage is also responsive to mobile devices.  

Here is an example of the responsive web page created, https://github.com/Ninax3/Mission-to-Mars/blob/main/Mars_Mobile_Responsive.png
